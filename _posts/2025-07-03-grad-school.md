Hi there! I’ve been excited to write this post since I completed the grad school application cycle this past April. I want to focus more on my personal experience here, as I know the application process is highly individual and dependent on your own unique experiences in undergrad (and what you want for your PhD)! But, I’ve also tried to add in some advice and online resources based on what I researched and observed when applying. My hope is that by sharing my experience with the PhD application process for neuroscience & psychology, I can help you understand what the process looks and feels like, and to help you know what to expect, as I know it can seem overwhelming! 

I also intend this post to be a living document, so if you have any comments or questions, feel free to send me an email at gebhart[at]stanford.edu and I’ll update accordingly!

# Notes

### August 8th:

I’ll be slowly adding to this post as this year’s application cycle progresses but feel free to send along any questions you have in the meantime. 

### November 12th:
A little later than I anticipated, but I've updated this post with my thoughts on applications!

# A Little Bit About My Background

My research experience in undergrad was pretty nonlinear. I started in physics, then moved to computer science, math, experimental psychology, and finally computational neuroscience. I had several reasons for doing this:
I thought I wanted to be a doctor until senior year of highschool, where in a medical internship I discovered I really didn’t like working in medicine. Coming into college, I wanted to try out research as an alternative but didn’t know exactly what I wanted to research. So, I thought I would try out everything that piqued my interest.
I thought it would be useful to have a broad background to draw from if I ended up wanting to be a researcher. 
My academic interests changed over the course of undergrad. I entered wanting to major in math and physics, and eventually dropped the physics for cognitive science. I’ve always been interested in cognition and realized that studying it from a mathematical/physics-informed perspective is quite satisfying!

I had a few areas I would be willing to complete my PhD in which made it both easy and difficult to apply. It maybe could have helped if I waited a year to apply and tried to find a lab to work in for a year post-grad. But at the time, I felt ready and had several reasons for applying immediately after undergrad:
- I love research
- The community
- Opportunities for teaching and mentorship
- Personal motivation to make a research contribution

That being said, before applying I think it’s useful to think about why you want to go to graduate school regardless of your experience. Some reasons I’ve heard not to just go to graduate school
- It’s the next thing to do. 
- You don’t know what to do after college.
- You aren’t resilient or capable of coping with failure. 

To relieve the pressure: I’ve also learned that there is no "typical applicant". The best thing to be is yourself (but professional, of course) and not stick too closely to what other people have done. Because then you won’t be representing yourself and your interests!

# Variations in Programs

While PhD programs in Psychology and Neuroscience are pretty similar, the biggest difference often lies in the first year. Broadly, programs tend to be either rotation-based or direct admit. In a rotation-based program, you spend your first year working in several different labs (usually two to four) before choosing your thesis advisor. This setup allows you to explore a range of research areas, lab environments, and mentorship styles before committing to one for your dissertation work. In direct-admit programs, you enter the PhD already matched with a specific faculty member and lab. This can be great if you already know exactly what research questions excite you and have a strong working relationship with a potential advisor. However, it also means you’re essentially committed from day one. If the project, mentoring style, or lab culture isn’t the right fit, it can be hard (but not impossible) to pivot.

### A Typical Timeline
Regardless of format, most PhD programs in neuroscience or psychology follow a similar general structure:
#### Year 1:
Rotations or a first-year research project
Coursework (ethics, statistics or quantitative methods, computational modeling, psychology/neuroscience core courses)
#### Year 2:
Join a thesis lab
Take qualifying or candidacy exams (“quals”)
Develop and defend a dissertation proposal
#### Years 3 and Beyond:
Conduct dissertation research
Write and defend your dissertation


### Choosing Between Rotation and Direct Admit
Most programs I applied to were rotation-based, but interestingly, my final decision came down to choosing between a rotation and a direct-admit program. I ultimately chose the rotation-based option. For me, it offered flexibility and the chance to find an advisor whose mentoring style and research focus truly aligned with my interests.
Many people choose rotation-based programs for that same reason. They don’t want to commit to a lab before getting a sense of how the environment actually feels day to day and whether they have a good dynamic with the PI (principal investigator) of the lab. But others thrive in direct-admit programs because they already have a clear research direction and want to dive in immediately.
Ultimately, neither is “better” than the other. It depends on you and your confidence in your research goals and knowledge of what kind of environment you need to be most successful.

# Thoughts About the Timeline
PhD applications are a long process. A really long process, in my opinion (and depending on how much of a planner you are). And there's a great reason for it - on your end, there’s a lot of decisions to make, materials to prepare, and essays to write and on their end, they need to take the time to choose which of you to interview involving several looks over your applications, big meetings, etc.

I maybe started planning out my applications a bit too far in advance but this is roughly the process I followed: 

### December 2024
- Pretty thoroughly researched schools to apply to. 
- Made a spreadsheet of 25 or so “top” schools, noting which advisors I’d want to work with at each. 

### May 2024
- Started asking for letters of recommendation. Maybe too early but I was applying to a lot so wanted to make sure they could be written. 
- Narrowed down my list of schools to 15 or so I was really considering. Started looking at application requirements for each school.

### July 2024
- Started brainstorming personal statements and writing my first drafts. 

### August 2024
- Prepping my CV
- And writing applications…

### September 2024
- Started showing application drafts to professors, friends, and family to get feedback.

### October 2024
- Still writing away…
- Personalizing the draft statements I’d written to individual programs.

### November 2024
- Got things ready to submit, including gathering transcripts, etc.

### December 2024
- December 1st was my latest deadline. I had everything in before Thanksgiving break so I could focus on finishing the semester strong.
- Started hearing back about interviews in mid-December.

### January 2025
- Kept hearing about interviews and rejections
- Had my first few in-person and zoom interviews

### February 2025
- More interviews…
- Heard back about more interviews and rejections…
- Started hearing back from graduate schools about interview outcomes

### March 2025
- The last interviews… 
- And heard back from the last few schools
- Made my decision at the end of the month

### April 2025
- April 15th (normally, I think) is Decision Day!

# Preparing Your Applications!

## Recommendations
Strong letters of application make a huge difference in your application. They help the admissions committee see who others thing you are as a researcher (in addition to what you’ve self-reported in your application), as well as your potential as a scientist. 

### Who to Ask?
The strongest letters will usually come from faculty members (with a PhD) who have directly overseen your research. But, letter writers can also include: a course instructor or professor who knows your academic performance and work ethic well, or a post-doc you’ve worked with). It’s generally not recommended to ask graduate students for letters since admissions tend to weigh letters from faculty more heavily. 

The importance of choosing a balanced set of recommenders is understated I think. Ideally, you want your letters of recommendation to support, emphasize, and/or supplement the claims you’ve made in your application (regarding research experience, extracurriculars, academic performance, etc.). Rather than choosing letter writers who all have the same perspective on your work, choose ones (if possible) that can offer a different perspectives on you as a scientist. 

For example, I chose two of my PIs (one who I had worked with one-on-one for about three years who knew my technical and critical thinking skills well, and one who I had worked in numerous group settings with and who had witnessed more of the mentoring side of my research capabilities) and one professor I’d taken many classes with and TA-ed for twice (she could reflect on my academic performance, enthusiasm for teaching and mentoring, and passion for computational neuroscience). 

### Ask early (and often)
Professors are balancing research, teaching, maybe multiple letter requests at once. Give them as much time as possible, ideally at least a month before the deadline, and keep in mind earlier is ALWAYS better. When reaching out to professors for a letter, try to ask in person. It makes it easier to discuss details and show that the request matters to you (and it’s harder for them to say no). 

Also, it’s always best to make writing you a letter as easy as possible for your recommenders. If you are applying to several programs, I’ve found it helpful to share a short spreadsheet that includes: program names and deadlines, specific guidelines for recommendations, how to submit the letter, and a checkbox for them to click once they’ve submitted the letter (to give you peace of mind). I’ve also found it helpful to send along my CV, a list of significant experiences, accomplishments, and/or interactions you’ve had with your letter writer, and my statements (if they’re done in time, or at least a little outline of what I’m planning to write about). 

In addition to this spreadsheet, I often remind my letter writers about a week before each deadline via email and a few days before to the day of the deadline. These reminders often aren’t seen as an annoyance, but are greatly appreciated in my experience.

## Transcripts
This one’s simple but important: order your transcripts early. 

I ran into a little conundrum where I realized I hadn’t requested my official transcripts from community colleges I attended during high school (containing credits that counted towards my undergraduate degree). But programs required that I submit official transcripts from each institution where you’ve earned credit, even if those credits were later transferred.  

Don’t be like me. But also don’t panic if you are late on this, most programs mainly want to verify that you’ve completed the coursework you’ve listed, which can be done with just your undergraduate transcript. 

Another note: make sure to unencrypt your official transcripts before uploading once you send them to yourself. There are a number of free websites to do this, some of which will watermark your transcript and others which will not. But either can be submitted. 


## Essays!
Ah, the essays… There are two main types of essays in PhD applications: statements of purpose and personal statements. Some programs also ask for a diversity statement or other short supplemental essays. 

### Statement of Purpose
The **statement of purpose (SOP)** is a chance for you to answer:
- Why do you want to do a PhD in Blah discipline? 
- Why are you qualified to do this PhD? 
- What do you plan to do in the PhD, and specifically, Blah PhD at Snarf University? 
- What do you want to do long-term (career plans) and how does Blah PhD at Snarf University align with that?
  
In this essay, you’re telling the story of who you are as a scientist. There is a general formula for writing this essay that looks something like this: 
- 10% Introduction (with a narrative hook about how you got into science, were motivated to pursue a research career or a PhD) and thesis statement (why you? why now? doing what in the proposed program? And why you need a PhD?)
- 60% Research Experience (little summaries of your research experience focusing specifically on how you got involved with the lab you were working in, what questions you were trying to answer, what you contributed to answering those questions, products of the research, and what you learned from it and how to connects to why you want to pursue a PhD now)
- 10% Other Motivations (I included some relevant highlights from a few classes I took and my computational neuroscience TA-ing experience)
- 20% Why Snarf University (focus on why the school you’re applying to is ideal for you to be trained as a scientist, what you can contribute to their community, and who you would want to work with at that university). 

### Personal Statement
In your **personal statement (PS)**, you are discussing who you are as a person and scientist. It’s a chance for you to answer:
Who are you as a scientist? 
What is your personal motivation for wanting to do a PhD? 
What has your scientific journey been like? 
Personal motivations? 
You can think about it as the motivation behind your CV, and can include more experiences and motivations outside of your research than are typically advised in the SOP. 

### Diversity Statement
Most schools didn’t ask me for a personal statement but for a **diversity statement**. Diversity can mean a lot of things. It’s not just about identity but also about the perspectives, experiences, and values that you bring to a field.  Here are some examples I included: 
Growing up in a rural area with limited access to science programs and taking the initiative to teach myself science.
Working as a math tutor at a liberal arts college and learning how to find ways to make concepts interesting and accessible to students with distinct backgrounds and learning styles. 
Leading diversity oriented student-organizations.
Advocating for accessibility in research through making my work open-access, promoting ease of understanding in my presentations, etc. 

### Supplemental Essays
Some programs throw in **supplemental essay** prompts. It’s helpful to keep a few short anecdotes or stories in your back pocket that you can adapt for different prompts. These stories can often double as great talking points during interviews.

Also - you can repeat your statements for schools! I had the same base paragraphs for 75% of my SOP for almost all schools and swapped out the rest for information specific to each program. At the end of the day, make sure it sounds like you, not anybody else. I think having my voice in my statement helped me out a lot. With that in mind, having family read them (or someone who knows you (not just research you, very well) can be helpful.
