Hi there! I’ve been excited to write this post since I completed the grad school application cycle this past April. I want to focus more on my personal experience here, as I know the application process is highly individual and dependent on your own unique experiences in undergrad (and what you want for your PhD)! But, I’ve also tried to add in some advice and online resources based on what I researched and observed when applying. My hope is that by sharing my experience with the PhD application process for neuroscience & psychology, I can help you understand what the process looks and feels like, and to help you know what to expect, as I know it can seem overwhelming! 

I also intend this post to be a living document, so if you have any comments or questions, feel free to send me an email at gebhart[at]stanford.edu and I’ll update accordingly!

### August 8th:

I’ll be slowly adding to this post as this year’s application cycle progresses but feel free to send along any questions you have in the meantime.

# Variations in Programs

Typically (at least for the programs I looked into), PhD programs in Psychology and Neuroscience all look pretty similar, except for the first year. In the first year, programs either tend to be rotation based, or you are directly admitted into a lab. In rotation based programs, you’ll rotate through a few labs before joining a thesis lab.

But in general, programs tend to look something like this:
### Year 1: 
- Rotations or First Year Project
- Classes including: ethics, statistics or math, computational course, other psychology or neuroscience courses
### Year 2
- Join thesis lab
- Quals 
- Develop proposal…
### Year 3 and Beyond
- Dissertation 

Most programs I applied to were rotation based, but funny enough I was choosing between a rotation and direct admit program at the end. There’s benefits to either, it just depends a lot on you and what you want to get out of your PhD. 

Personally, I preferred (and chose) a rotation-based program. Other reasons I’ve heard people say to choose a rotation type program include the fact that you can get stuck with a great (or not so great) advisor with direct admit (it’s a bit of a gamble unless you know them personally) and you’re locked into a lab and research topic (no room for exploration).

# Thoughts About the Timeline
PhD applications are a long process. A really long process, in my opinion (and depending on how much of a planner you are). And there's a great reason for it - on your end, there’s a lot of decisions to make, materials to prepare, and essays to write and on their end, they need to take the time to choose which of you to interview involving several looks over your applications, big meetings, etc.

I maybe started planning out my applications a bit too far in advance but this is roughly the process I followed: 

### December 2024
- Pretty thoroughly researched schools to apply to. 
- Made a spreadsheet of 25 or so “top” schools, noting which advisors I’d want to work with at each. 

### May 2024
- Started asking for letters of recommendation. Maybe too early but I was applying to a lot so wanted to make sure they could be written. 
- Narrowed down my list of schools to 15 or so I was really considering. Started looking at application requirements for each school.

### July 2024
- Started brainstorming personal statements and writing my first drafts. 

### August 2024
- Prepping my CV
- And writing applications…

### September 2024
- Started showing application drafts to professors, friends, and family to get feedback.

### October 2024
- Still writing away…
- Personalizing the draft statements I’d written to individual programs.

### November 2024
- Got things ready to submit, including gathering transcripts, etc.

### December 2024
- December 1st was my latest deadline. I had everything in before Thanksgiving break so I could focus on finishing the semester strong.
- Started hearing back about interviews in mid-December.

### January 2025
- Kept hearing about interviews and rejections
- Had my first few in-person and zoom interviews

### February 2025
- More interviews…
- Heard back about more interviews and rejections…
- Started hearing back from graduate schools about interview outcomes

### March 2025
- The last interviews… 
- And heard back from the last few schools
- Made my decision at the end of the month

### April 2025
- April 15th (normally, I think) is Decision Day!
