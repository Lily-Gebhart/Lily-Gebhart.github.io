In my last post, I mentioned in the “Unconventional Advice” section that I had applied to a lot of summer programs. In all, I applied to 45 of these programs while in undergrad and was fortunate enough to get into several every summer. In this post, I will walk through what summer research entails, how to apply, programs for American students, and more! In the spirit of full transparency, I’ve also included my application materials for all the programs I got into, so you can see how my skills as a writer and researcher developed over time—and hopefully use that as a guide for your own applications.

As a disclaimer, I was lucky enough to realize early on that I wanted to do research and have access to resources that enabled me to do research every summer while I was in college. The summer after my freshman year, I worked at Occidental under the Research Early Access Program. After my sophomore year, I joined an summer program at Rutgers University under the DIMACS (Discrete Math and Theoretical Computer Science) NSF REU. After my junior year, I was  supported by Occidental’s Science Scholars Program and did a part-time, remote internship with the University of Missouri - Columbia Neuroscience NSF REU. 

In this post, my goal is to give you all that I’ve learned about the summer research application process. Please feel free to reach out at gebhart [at] stanford [dot] edu if you have any questions, comments, or want to chat!
