In my last post, I mentioned in the “Unconventional Advice” section that I had applied to a lot of summer programs. In all, I applied to 45 of these programs while in undergrad and was fortunate enough to get into several every summer. In this post, I will walk through what summer research entails, how to apply, programs for American students, and more! In the spirit of full transparency, I’ve also included my application materials for all the programs I got into, so you can see how my skills as a writer and researcher developed over time and hopefully use it as a guide for your own applications.

As a disclaimer, I was lucky enough to realize early on that I wanted to do research and have access to resources that enabled me to do research every summer while I was in college. The summer after my freshman year, I worked at Occidental under the Research Early Access Program. After my sophomore year, I joined an summer program at Rutgers University under the DIMACS (Discrete Math and Theoretical Computer Science) NSF REU. After my junior year, I was  supported by Occidental’s Science Scholars Program and did a part-time, remote internship with the University of Missouri-Columbia Neuroscience NSF REU. 

In this post, my goal is to give you all that I’ve learned about the summer research application process. Please feel free to reach out at gebhart [at] stanford [dot] edu if you have any questions, comments, or want to chat! 

# Notes 
**12/10** In construction...

# First off, why summer research?
- Summers are often easiest to devote to research since you aren’t busy with classes and other during-the-semester obligations. 
- There’s a lot more funded opportunities in the summer than during the academic year (especially at other institutions or internationally).
- Summers are the only time to experience full time research looks like while you are still in undergrad!
- Summers allow you to get truly immersed in the research process since you are minimally distracted from other obligations (compared to the rest of the academic year). I found summer research to be the best time to learn whether research was really for me. I also had drastically different experiences in all labs I worked in, which helped me learn what kind of environment (and topics!) I was interested in studying in my PhD.

# What kinds of summer research opportunities are there?
**Short Answer:** A ton. **Long Answer:** It really depends on where the funding is coming from and what kind of research you're interested in. 

Here's a few of the avenues I'm familiar with for American students:

1. **Home University Programs**
Many colleges and universities in the U.S. run their own internal summer research programs for their own students. These programs often provide a stipend, some form of housing and mealplan, and program activities for students' research development (and for fun!). They're a great way to get hands on experience, get more familiar with what kind of research is done at your institution, and be better integrated into your institution's research community.

2. **U.S. Government Funded Opportunities**
The most notable programs here are the NSF REU programs (National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates). These programs are funded by the National Science Foundation and allow students from different institutions to try out research with faculty and departments participating in the program at different institutions across the U.S.. Like "home university programs", these research experiences also provide a stipend, housing, airfare or trael support, activities inside and outside of research, and sometimes funding to present your work at a conference.

3. **Privately Funded Opportunities**
These programs are similar to government funded programs in every way except where the funding is coming from!

4. **International Opportunities**
These programs are again, similar in structure to U.S. government funded programs but are take place internationally! Application requirements may differ from national programs.

# How long are summer research programs?
Summer research programs are typically about 6-12 weeks long, with 8-10 weeks the most common length. They either tend to fall along the semester or quarter summer dates, which unfortunately limits the programs you can join (if your university is on a semester schedule attending a "quarter-compatible" program will potentially result in you missing the first few weeks of your fall semester and if your university is on a quarter schedule attending a "semester-compatible" program will potentially result in you missing the last few weeks of your spring quarter). 

# Where can I find summer research opportunities?
I’m going to focus specifically on STEM programs since I don’t know as much about research in the humanities. Here are a few resources for each of the categories described above:

1. **Home University Programs**  
Check with your school! 

2. **U.S. Government Funded Opportunities**  
The thing about NSF REUs is that all opportunities aren’t available on a standardized website. While they are all advertised together (in locations I added here), all programs have separate sites hosted by each institution or department. The NSF list is the most comprehensive source of information on what REUs are out there but it is sometimes out of date. Best practice is to google the names of the programs you’re interested in and try to find their individual websites. 

- [(New) General Website](https://etap.nsf.gov/)
  - While I was applying to programs, the NSF was gradually transferring information from their old website over to this site! It’s a lot easier to navigate! 
- [(Old) General Website](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu/search)
  - There should still be opportunities on this site! But, make sure to google the names of the programs and find the insitution-maintained site before you decide to apply. 
- [Math-specific REU Programs](https://sites.google.com/view/mathreu/program-list) 
  - This is a wonderful, annually-updated resource for finding REU programs in math research!

3. **Privately Funded Opportunities**

- [AMGEN Scholars](https://amgenscholars.com/) 
  - There’s programs at Caltech, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Harvard, WUSTL, UNC Chapel Hill, NIH, etc. 
- [Pathways to Science Program Listings](PathwaysToScience.org)
  - This site has many fulled funded STEM research programs! 

4. **International Opportunities**
- [Fulbright Canada-Mitacs Globalink Program](https://www.fulbright.ca/programs/undergraduate-students/fulbright-canada-mitacs-globalink-program)
- [ThinkSwiss Research Scholarships](https://swissnex.org/services/academia/thinkswiss-research-scholarships-north-america/)
- [DAAD RISE (Germany)](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-germany/)

This is not an exhaustive list, but will hopefully get you started! Most universities also maintain a list of external summer research programs.
