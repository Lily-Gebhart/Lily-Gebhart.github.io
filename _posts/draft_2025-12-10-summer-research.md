In my last post, I mentioned in the “Unconventional Advice” section that I had applied to a lot of summer programs. In all, I applied to 45 of these programs while in undergrad and was fortunate enough to get into several every summer. In this post, I will walk through what summer research entails, how to apply, programs for American students, and more! In the spirit of full transparency, I’ve also included my application materials for all the programs I got into, so you can see how my skills as a writer and researcher developed over time and hopefully use it as a guide for your own applications.

As a disclaimer, I was lucky enough to realize early on that I wanted to do research and have access to resources that enabled me to do research every summer while I was in college. The summer after my freshman year, I worked at Occidental under the Research Early Access Program. After my sophomore year, I joined an summer program at Rutgers University under the DIMACS (Discrete Math and Theoretical Computer Science) NSF REU. After my junior year, I was  supported by Occidental’s Science Scholars Program and did a part-time, remote internship with the University of Missouri-Columbia Neuroscience NSF REU. 

In this post, my goal is to give you all that I’ve learned about the summer research application process. Please feel free to reach out at gebhart [at] stanford [dot] edu if you have any questions, comments, or want to chat! 

# Notes 
**12/10** In construction...

# First off, why summer research?
- Summers are often easiest to devote to research since you aren’t busy with classes and other during-the-semester obligations. 
- There’s a lot more funded opportunities in the summer than during the academic year (especially at other institutions or internationally).
- Summers are the only time to experience full time research looks like while you are still in undergrad!
- Summers allow you to get truly immersed in the research process since you are minimally distracted from other obligations (compared to the rest of the academic year). I found summer research to be the best time to learn whether research was really for me. I also had drastically different experiences in all labs I worked in, which helped me learn what kind of environment (and topics!) I was interested in studying in my PhD.

# What kinds of summer research opportunities are there?
**Short Answer:** A ton. **Long Answer:** It really depends on where the funding is coming from and what kind of research you're interested in. 

Here's a few of the avenues I'm most familiar with for American students:
1. **Home University Programs:**
Many colleges and universities in the U.S. run their own internal summer research programs for their own students. These programs often provide a stipend, some form of housing and mealplan, and program activities for students' research development (and for fun!). They're a great way to get hands on experience,
