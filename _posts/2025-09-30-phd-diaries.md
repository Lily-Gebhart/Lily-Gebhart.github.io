Copying quite a few bloggers and vloggers out there, I thought it might be fun to document how my PhD’s been going up until this point and of course to give back to the graduate school application and survival literature. I’m going to (try to) do this bullet point and stream-of-consciousness style (to take the pressure off myself and challenge my perfectionistic tendencies), and try to include some paper/book recs each week.

Our program, as I’ve been learning, is a little different than most. We had two days of orientation and a two week bootcamp (Stanford Immersive Neuroscience) prior to the start of the semester. The bootcamp featured short lectures each morning by a different member of the faculty, The focus of the bootcamp was mostly cell & molec, and specifically glial biology. Besides knowing about glioblastoma (for reasons I may get to at some point) and some quick coverage in my Cognitive Neuroscience class at OXY, I was completely in the dark. But I think I managed to figure a lot of it out, especially once I realized that almost nobody else knew what was happening either. 

The actual PhD (and quarter) started last week. It featured:
Imposter Syndrome (always it seems lately, though it’s getting a little better)
* A LOT of free food and welcome events. My social battery is beyond dead at this point.
* A lack of card access to my lab (yet, but coming soon!)
* A return to rock climbing. Stanford has a great climbing wall and while I kinda suck, I can see the appeal now. 
* I got fMRI scanned this past weekend. It was quite the experience and has me thinking/reconsidering a lot about the method. 
* My first (little) symposium! For the Precision Mental Health Center. It was quite fantastic. 

I have never been in a place where I felt so simultaneously at home, intimidated, personally and intellectually inspired, and struck by imposter syndrome. I still don’t think I’m fully convinced me being here isn’t a fluke. But I think that is normal. I think (or maybe just hope) that everybody who starts a PhD feels this way. It’s a scary thing, and as every blog, professor and other resource you might come across emphasizes, it’s way different than undergrad. 

But it’s also so freeing. I remember when I was at Rutgers, this PhD student Caleb and director of the program, Lazaros, told us over and over: this is how grad school is going to feel! We had pretty much free reign over the Piscataway campus of Rutgers that summer aside from my twice-a-week meetings with John Kolassa. And it was fantastic. 

Especially being primarily computational (at least this rotation), I can kind of go wherever I want to work. My favorite spot (where I am now) is the Li Ka Shing Center, primarily for medical students but also biosciences PhD students. But being in the lab is pretty nice too and I have been trying to spend most of my working hours there. 

For having worked on working memory to some degree in two projects, there is an insane amount I don’t know. And while that's to be expected, I guess I wasn't aware of just how much there is out there. I spent my whole first week of the rotation just reading and I think that’s how I’m about to spend the second week. Though I finally moved onto project framing today, so I guess that’s promising. 

Going off some of my earlier points, it’s been a bit nerve-wracking to feel like I’m a lot more in the dark than everyone here. Even on computational stuff. For example, I hardly used the terminal in undergrad to do anything more than absolute basics and it was thoroughly explained to me for the first time yesterday in a data science workshop. But I’ve been trying to think of how much I’ve learned the past few weeks, and it’s actually crazy! They have done a good job of administering a flood of information. And I appreciate it. 

I also feel like I’ve been pretty intimidated when people have been asking what I’m interested in. I know what I’m NOT interested in. And I have some hot takes on that (maybe for another time). But I feel like there is so much I am or might be interested in that it’s always hard to say. Maybe I’ll talk about that another time. But I feel like I answer that question different every time based on the context, and it's hard not to feel weird about that.
