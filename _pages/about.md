Hi there! I'm a first-year Neurosciences PhD student at Stanford University interested in understanding the neural basis of cognition and how it is implicated in individuals with neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders and brain cancer. 

I received my B.A. in Cognitive Science and Mathematics, with minors in Neuroscience and Computer Science, from Occidental College in 2025. While in undergrad, I worked with [Dan Snowden Ifft](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/faculty/daniel-snowden-ifft), [John Kolassa](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/people-pages/faculty/people/395-john-kolassa), [Carmel Levitan](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/faculty/carmel-levitan) and [Aysha Motala](https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/1791684), [Justin Li](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/faculty/justin-li), and [Satish Nair](https://nairs.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/home) on projects spanning physics, statistics, cognitive science, computer science, and computational neuroscience. 

Passionate about understanding individual differences in cognition and the application of this understanding to the real world, my research interests extend beyond the bounds of neuroscience. I recently joined the board of [Milton Marks Family Camp (MMFC)](https://www.miltonmarksfamilycamp.org/) to study psychosocial coping in families affected by brain cancer and I am working with [Steven Michael Crane]() to explore mechanisms of human flourishing and social connection. 

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat - I'm always happy to help!

Outside of research, I enjoy teaching, coffee, knitting, and spending time outdoors!
