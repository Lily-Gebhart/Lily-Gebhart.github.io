Hi there! This fall, I'll be beginning my PhD in Neurosciences at Stanford University. I am interested in understanding how neurological and psychiatric disease affects cognition from a computational perspective.

I received my B.A. in Cognitive Science and Mathematics with minors in Neuroscience and Computer Science from Occidental College in 2025. While in undergrad, I worked with [Dan Snowden Ifft](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/faculty/daniel-snowden-ifft), [John Kolassa](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/people-pages/faculty/people/395-john-kolassa), [Carmel Levitan](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/faculty/carmel-levitan) and [Aysha Motala](https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/1791684), [Justin Li](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/faculty/justin-li), and [Satish Nair](https://nairs.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/home) on projects in physics, statistics, cognitive science, computer science, and computational neuroscience. 

Outside of research, I also enjoy teaching, healthcare & educational outreach, coffee, knitting, and anything and everything outdoors!
