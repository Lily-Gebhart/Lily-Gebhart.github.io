Communication in the brain is the key component underlying neural functions such as movement, memory formation and decision-making. In this primer, we characterize structural and functional mechanisms which implement communication at the cellular, network and system level. We then discuss data and computational models which can be used to study these mechanisms and provide hands-on examples implemented in Google Colab. Unifying the findings, we outline the structure of a computational model for testing the recently proposed spatial computing hypothesis, which describes memory encoding and retrieval in the prefrontal cortex.
